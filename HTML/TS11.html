        <p>A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to
            keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch
            is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, 
            including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed 
            for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.
